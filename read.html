        <h1>BILL GATES WIKIPEDIA</h1>
        Bill Gates, in full William Henry Gates III, (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), American
        computer
        programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world’s largest personal-computer software
        company.

        Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group of programmers
        who
        computerized their school’s payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems
        to
        local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G.
        Allen to
        develop software for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used
        on
        large computers, for use on microcomputers. With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his
        junior year
        and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates’s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when
        Microsoft
        licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation—then the world’s
        biggest
        computer supplier and industry pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer).
        After the
        machine’s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise
        pushed out
        competing operating systems. While Microsoft’s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly
        manipulated the
        larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of IBM-compatible
        PCs, or
        clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC
        industry’s
        ultimate kingmaker.Largely on the strength of Microsoft’s success, Gates amassed a huge paper fortune as the
        company’s largest individual
        shareholder. He became a paper billionaire in 1986, and within a decade his net worth had reached into the tens
        of
        billions of dollars—making him by some estimates the world’s richest private individual. With few interests
        beyond
        software and the potential of information technology, Gates at first preferred to stay out of the public eye,
        handling
        civic and philanthropic affairs indirectly through one of his foundations. Nevertheless, as Microsoft’s power
        and
        reputation grew, and especially as it attracted the attention of the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust
        division,
        Gates, with some reluctance, became a more public figure. Rivals (particularly in competing companies in Silicon
        Valley)
        portrayed him as driven, duplicitous, and determined to profit from virtually every electronic transaction in
        the world.
        His supporters, on the other hand, celebrated his uncanny business acumen, his flexibility, and his boundless
        appetite
        for finding new ways to make computers and electronics more useful through software.
